# Praveen Rangavajhula – Machine Learning Portfolio

Hi, I'm **Praveen Rangavajhula**, a graduate student at the **University of Georgia** with a focus on **machine learning** and **data-driven research projects**. I am continuously exploring various areas of ML and improving my technical skills through academic projects, research, and hands-on experimentation.

This portfolio highlights key projects and areas of learning as I continue to develop expertise in machine learning.
