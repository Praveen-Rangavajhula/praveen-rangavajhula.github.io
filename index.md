# Praveen Rangavajhula â€“ Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Praveen, a graduate student at the University of Georgia focused on machine learning and data-driven research.

This portfolio is a work in progress where I share my projects and ideas in ML. Feel free to explore and learn more about what I do:

- **[About Me](about.md):** A brief introduction and background.
- **[Projects](projects.md):** Details on my ML projects and research efforts.

*Stay tuned as I update and expand the content over time!*
