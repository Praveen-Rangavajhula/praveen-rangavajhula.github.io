# Hey, I'm Praveen Rangavajhula ðŸ‘‹  

I got into Machine Learning in **January 2024**, and since then, itâ€™s been a constant process of learning, experimenting, and building. 
I started with [**CS229 by Andrew Ng**](https://cs229.stanford.edu/) and watched the [**lecture series**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU), 
worked on a few [**Kaggle projects**](https://github.com/Praveen-Rangavajhula/Machine-Learning-Basics), and took courses like **ML in IoT, Privacy-Preserving ML, and Data Mining** as part of my master's coursework.  

One of the most exciting parts of my journey has been my **masterâ€™s project**, which started as a custom RNN in Scala and eventually turned
into **building an autograd system from scratch**. I enjoy implementing things myself to deepen my understandingâ€”like building an autograd system in Scala 
instead of just using PyTorchâ€™s Autograd.  

Right now, Iâ€™m diving into **Deep Learning & NLP**, working through [**Stanford CS224N**](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) and 
the [**Deep Learning Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) to strengthen my understanding of modern architectures. 
Iâ€™ve also been documenting my learning process by taking [**CS224N notes and solving assignments**](https://github.com/Praveen-Rangavajhula/cs224n-notes) on my own.  

Lately, Iâ€™ve been exploring **Federated Sustainable Learning** through **research at UGA** with a team. We're currently surveying the **carbon footprint of different models on Jetson devices**, 
which has been particularly exciting and interesting.
