I am broadly interested in understanding how learning occurs in machine learning systems.

My Master’s work involved building custom autograd systems, privacy-preserving optimization,
and sustainability-focused
federated learning, which motivated my current research interests.

My current focus is exploratory and centers on learning dynamics and alternatives to standard backpropagation,
particularly in settings where interpretability and sustainability matter.
