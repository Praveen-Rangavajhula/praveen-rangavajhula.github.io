I am broadly interested in understanding how learning occurs in machine learning systems.

My Master's work involved building custom autograd systems, privacy-preserving optimization,
and sustainability-focused federated learning, which motivated my current research interests.

My current focus is exploratory and centers on learning dynamics and alternatives to standard backpropagation,
particularly in settings where interpretability and sustainability matter. I’m also interested in how advances 
in learning dynamics and model interpretability can improve real-world AI systems that need to understand and
reason about complex, structured data.

More broadly, I’ve spent some time learning the basics of agentic AI and agent-based workflows to understand
how machine learning models are used in systems that act over multiple steps rather than producing
single-shot predictions. I’m interested in how machine learning research translates into deployed systems,
particularly in settings where the work has real impact, and I’m open to engaging with agentic AI and
agent-based workflows when they arise in such contexts.
